Mt Davidson 2023_05_11 SOTA de KD0FNR
First SOTA with new pwr mod and a naked radio. \nThe naked radio caused large broadcast station issues. These could be reduced by coiling CAT-6 and moving my position under the radio. Having both battery packs on at once changed conditions unpredictably. (e.g. more noise reduction, but dit button sounded weird.) \n> 30 dB into Canada!
